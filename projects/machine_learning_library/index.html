title: machine learning library

	<p>
	I took a graduate level course in machine learning from Dr. Mike Gashler
	at the University of Arkansas during the fall of 2016. Although we covered
	a spectrum of machine learning algorithms in the course it was predominantly
	focused on artificial neural network algorithms (algorithms that take inspiration
	from how neurons in our brains work). We had many coding assignments throughout
	the course and I built a small C++ library that implements a few 
	machine learning algorithms.
	</p>

	I used the this library to complete homework assignments and do a final 
	project where I used a neural network model to predict the off center 
	displacements of handwritten numbers (the MNIST data set which I modified).
	You can checkout my final <em>
