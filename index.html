	<h1>Welcome to Joseph Carmack's personal website!</h1>
	<p>
    The purpose of my website is two fold. First it is a place people can
    come to learn about me, my interests, research I follow and do, educational
    resources I like and have used as well as those I have made, and more stuff.
    Second, I use this website as a place to summarize my own learning. In a way
    it is a journal of things I am learning and don't want to forget. Another way
    of putting it is that this page is an extension of my memory.
    <a href="/about">Read more about me...</a>
