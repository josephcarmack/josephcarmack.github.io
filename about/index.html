	I am currently pursuing a PhD in mechanical engineering at 
	the University of Arkansas. I use computational models to explore how to create new
	materials with technological significance. Outside of my research I have spent my efforts
	studying machine learning and artificial intelligence.

	I am a family man as well as a person of faith. My wife and I live for each other and our
	kids and enjoy doing things outdoors together. We dream of a modest house on some land
	with plenty of room to tinker, play, and learn, ideally located close to our extended 
	family in either New England are the Mountain West.

	I spent two years living in Taiwan as a missionary for my church where I became fluent
	in Mandarin Chinese and developed a love for the Chinese people. Although my Chinese
	has gotten a little rusty, I'm still able to keep up with our many Chinese friends 
	locally and abroad.
