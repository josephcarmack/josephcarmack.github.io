    I am currently pursuing a PhD in mechanical engineering at the University
    of Arkansas. I develop and use computational models to explore how to
    create advanced materials for emerging technologies. I particularly enjoy
    programming in python and C++ and have several active programming projects
    that I am contributing to, most of which can be found on my <a
    href="https://github.com/josephcarmack">GitHub profile</a>. Outside of my
    research I have spent my efforts studying machine learning and artificial
    intelligence which I found a passion for a few years ago.

    I enjoying learning new skills, mostly in STEM related areas, but I also
    have interests in philosophy, music, and health. I aspire to write some in
    the areas of philosophy of science, to play the piano and ukulele well, and
    enjoy a variety of sports and physical exercise (basketball, hockey, swimming,
    weight lifting, and body weight routines).

    I am religious and see no conflict between science and religion as some do.
    To me they are both methods used to search for and discover truth. I spent
    two years living in Taiwan as a missionary for my church where I became
    fluent in Mandarin Chinese and developed a love for the Chinese people.
    Although my Chinese has gotten a little rusty, I'm still able to keep up
    with our many Chinese friends locally and abroad.
