    My research experience began in my undergraduate studies in physics and
    mathematics. I did experimental work studying positron annihilation in
    materials to detect material defects. Next, I studied the solid state
    physics pertainig to complex magnetic materials. Computational physics and
    materials modeling was followed. I pursued this area of research into my
    graduate degree which is focused on computational materials science.

    In graduate school I have found a new passion for artificial intelligence
    and machine learning. I have particulary focused my study in the area of
    <a href="http://deeplearning.net/"><em>Deep Learning</em></a>, but am also 
    interested in other biologically inspired AI approaches such as the 
    <a href="https://numenta.com/biological-and-machine-intelligence/">
        hierarichical temporal memory theory</a> of the brain
    put forth by Jeff Hawkins. I hope to help develop AI technologies that will
    assist in and accelerate the research process in all fields.
