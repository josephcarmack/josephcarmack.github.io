    My research experience began in my undergraduate studies in physics and
    mathematics. I did experimental work studying positron annihilation in
    materials to detect material defects. Next, I studied the solid state physics
    pertainig to complex magnetic materials. Computational physics and materials
    modeling was next. I followed this area of research into my graduate degree
    which is focused on computational materials science. My research experiences
    have burned a love of physics, mathematics, and engineering into me.

    However, it was not until graduate school that I found the love of my research
    life -- intelligence. Intelligence as a general principle and how it is 
    implemented in the human mind.
