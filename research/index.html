    My research experience began in my undergraduate studies in physics and
    mathematics. I did experimental work studying positron annihilation in
    materials to detect material defects. Next, I studied the solid state physics
    pertainig to complex magnetic materials. Computational physics and materials
    modeling was next. I followed this area of research into my graduate degree
    which is focused on computational materials science. My research experiences
    have burned a love of physics, mathematics, and engineering into me.

    However, it was not until graduate school that I found the love of my research
    life -- intelligence. Intelligence as a general principle and how it is 
    implemented in the human mind.

    This page is dedicated to research topics that I am interested in. It includes:

    <ul>
        <li>A list of topcis I am interested in.</li>
        <li>A list of groups studying those topics with links to their work and
            summaries of their work authored by myself.</li>
        <li>Lists of research questions pertaining to my topics of interest.</li>
        <li>Links to my own research projects.</li>
    </ul>
